<h2>How Phorcysty Works</h2>


<p><strong>Select Your Media</strong></p>
<p> 
Choose one media as the source (from which the color style will be taken) and one media as the target (on which the color style will be applied).
This works for all combinations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Image to Image</li>
    <li>Video to Video</li>
    <li>Image to Video</li>
    <li>Video to Image</li>
</ul>

<p>One-Click Color Style Transfer
With a single tap, Phorcysty sends your selected media for AI-powered server-side processing, where pre-trained AI models analyze the color style of the source and apply it to the target.</p>

<p>AI Processing
The AI models extract color characteristics such as tone, balance, and overall color style, and transfer them to your target media while preserving its original structure and visual integrity.</p>

<p>Instant Preview
Once processing is complete, the result is displayed directly in the app so you can instantly see the transformed output.</p>

<p>Fine-Tune 
Adjust the final result using professional color enhancement tools:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Brightness</li>
    <li>Contrast</li>
    <li>Saturation</li>
    <li>Hue</li>
    <li>Temperature (Temp)</li>
    <li>Tint</li>
</ul>

<p>Undo and Redo options are available for easy control.</p>

<p><strong>Download Output</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the final result, you can download the processed image or video directly to your device.</p>

<h2>Performance & Processing Notes</h2>


<p>Phorcysty uses AI-powered server-side processing to perform color transfer, color style transformation, and color enhancement. This means the main processing happens on secure servers instead of your device, allowing better performance and more consistent results.</p>

<p><strong>Processing time may vary depending on factors such as:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Media size and resolution</li>
  <li>Video length</li>
  <li>Network speed and stability</li>
  <li>Current server load</li>
</ul>

<p>Results are generated automatically by AI models and are displayed in the app once processing is completed. While most results are delivered quickly, some operations may take a few moments for larger files or videos.</p>

<p>An active internet connection is required for AI-based features to work properly.</p>

<p>Phorcysty is designed to balance speed and quality, providing efficient processing while maintaining the visual integrity of your images and videos.</p>


<h2>Privacy & Data Handling</h2>


<p>Your privacy is important to us. Phorcysty processes your images and videos only to provide the requested AI-powered features such as color transfer, color style transformation, and color enhancement.</p>

<p>Selected media files are used strictly for temporary processing and are not permanently stored on our servers. Your images and videos are never used to train our AI models and are not shared with third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.</p>

<p>Processing is performed using secure, AI-powered server-side systems, and access to your data is limited only to what is necessary to complete the requested operations.</p>

<p>We may use trusted third-party services such as Google AdMob and Firebase Crashlytics for advertising, analytics, and app stability. These services may collect limited technical and device-related information in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they do not have access to your personal images or videos.</p>

<p>Phorcysty is designed to respect user privacy while delivering reliable and efficient AI-powered media processing.</p>


<h2>Limitations</h2>


<p>Phorcysty uses automated AI models to perform color transfer, color style transformation, and color enhancement. While the app is designed to deliver reliable and high-quality results, the final output may vary depending on several factors.</p>

<p><strong>Results may be affected by:</strong></p>

<ul> 
 <li>The quality, resolution, and lighting of the source and target media</li>

 <li>The complexity of colors and scenes</li>

 <li>Video length and file size</li>

 <li>Network speed and stability during processing</li>
</ul>
 
<p>AI-based processing does not guarantee perfect or identical results in every case. All results are generated automatically and are provided on an “as-is” basis.</p>

<p>Processing time may increase for large images or long videos, and performance may vary based on server load and internet connectivity.</p>

<p>These limitations are a normal part of AI-powered processing and do not indicate a fault in the application.</p>


<h2>Future Improvements</h2>


<p>We are continuously working to enhance Phorcysty and improve the overall user experience. In future updates, we may introduce improvements such as:</p>

<p>Faster and more optimized AI processing</p>

<p>Better support for higher-resolution images and longer videos</p>

<p>Enhanced color transfer accuracy and consistency</p>

<p>Additional color style options and refinements</p>

<p>Performance and stability improvements</p>

<p>UI and usability enhancements based on user feedback</p>

<p>All future improvements will be focused on making color transfer, color style transformation, and color enhancement more efficient, reliable, and easy to use, while maintaining strong privacy and data protection standards.</p>
